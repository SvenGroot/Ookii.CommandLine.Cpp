# Introduction

Ookii.CommandLine is a library that helps you with parsing the command line arguments for your
applications. In this guide, we will introduce the basic functionality using a tutorial, describe in
detail the command line parsing rules used and how to create various types of arguments, how to use
and customize usage help, and explain other functionality such as subcommands.

In addition to this documentation, several [samples](../samples) are provided, all with explanations
of what they do and examples of their output.
